Product Release Procedure for GemFire Products

 1. QA    Declare that a sanctioned build of product will soon be
            ready for release.  This can be email or verbal and
            may be as early as a few weeks before the scheduled
            release date but no later than 3 days before release.

need to cover steps for updating the docs
need to cover steps for providing new product sizes for docs before 
they're done.

 2. Manu  Create product part numbers and sign-off sheets.  Send the 
          sign-off sheets to QA and send the part numbers to the 
          "releases" email list. Manufacturing keeps the labels and 
          sets aside blank media for masters.

 3. QA    Review the bug list for bugnote candidates.

 4. QA    Release notes 
          Work with Docs to adjust bugnotes that live inside the
            product if needed.  Requires recalc of product checksums
            on unix and rebuilding the installer on NT.  It would be
            VERY GOOD to have a script that would verify the checksums,
            put in a new bugnotes file, and then recalc the checksum.

 5. Docs  Work with QA to change and review paper bugnotes, release notes,
              and install guides.

 6. QA    Make engineering archive in a location accessable from /gcm/where/...
            then make the engineering archive CDRs kept by Manufacturing.

          Example: 
          $ cd /gcm/where/gemfire/400/i86.Linux
          $ ./makeRLSsnap_unix > makeRLSsnap.log 2>&1

 7. QA    Declare product is now ready for release.
            ***** This needs to be two days or more before prodrev to  *****
            ***** allow time for QA to verify results of next 2 steps. *****

 8. Manu  Use release.pl to put product and source code to ship's inventory.
            The source of the release is the Engineering online archive.
            Requires ship password.  See Appendix A for detailed notes
            on using release.pl.

 9. Manu  Make product and source code master media.  This may be
            tape, CDRom, and/or floppies depending on the product.
            CDRom will be the prefered media.  Product and source
            go on separate media to limit the losses in the event of
            catastrophic media failure.  Requires ship password.
            See Appendix B for notes on making masters.

10. QA    Verify master media of product and source code.

             unzip -t on all .zip files

11. QA    Test installer and all installation docs from master media.

             Run installer off CD. Run the whole way through the install
             and then start the console and start and stop a system. 
             Once the system is stopped exit the console and run the 
             uninstaller. Once the uninstall is completed check to see 
             that there are leftover files/directories in the install
             location.

12. QA    Call prodrev meeting and hand master CDRoms, paper docs (bugnotes, 
          release notes, install guides), and completed sign-off sheets to 
          Manufacturing.

13. QA    Tag svn repository tree with release version.

          As user build cd to $gf40 and find out the svn revision the 
          sources are at: 

          svn info will provide the revision the sources are at. Use that in
          the <rev> below.  

          svn copy -r <rev> https://hera.gemstone.com/svn/gemfire/trunk \
            https://hera.gemstone.com/svn/gemfire/tags/gemfire400_release

14. Manu  Replace the old version of installers on the ftp_distribution/gemfire
          ftp site with the release installers from the Engineering Archive.
          Send the new download instructions to Stevens. 

14. Manu  Work with Docs and Tech Support to put items on the web (previously
            selected bugnotes, install guides, and possibly the product).

15. Manu  Archive sign-off sheets.

18. Manu  Send master media off-site.
Appendix A    Release.pl for GS products

Here is a primer on using the release.pl script for GemFire and related 
products.  Generally manufacturing will use this script but it will be 
documented here for future reference by any who may find a need to run 
the script.

THE RELEASE SCRIPT MUST BE RUN WHILE LOGGED IN AS USER "ship"!!!!!

For GemStone/S products the release script needs to be run from a machine 
with the same archtecture as the product being released except for PC 
products.  So, if you are releasing an HP product make sure you are logged 
on to an HP machine.  For PC prducts any machine will do but a Solaris 
machine will be the easiest to find.

For products that don't use the antiquted checksum process which include
GemStone/J, Facets and GemFire you can run the release for all the platforms
from a Solaris box.  

For releasing GemFire:
  /gcm/where/gemfire/40/sparc.Solaris/release/release.pl <prodNo> <rootDir>

   o   prodNo is the product number issued by Manufacturing
   o   rootDir is the directory path of the top level of a
       product's engineering archive.  It has directories
       "product", "hidden", "sources", and for PCs "installer"

/gcm/where/gemfire/40/sparc.Solaris/release/release/release.pl 13-50-4.0-0-0-0 /export/gemfire_archive/users/releases/GemFire4.0-i686.Linux

/gcm/where/gemfire/40/sparc.Solaris/release/release/release.pl 13-10-4.0-0-0-0 /export/gemfire_archive/users/releases/GemFire4.0-sparc.Solaris

/gcm/where/gemfire/40/sparc.Solaris/release/release/release.pl 13-11-4.0-0-0-0 /export/gemfire_archive/users/releases/GemFire4.0-x86.Windows_NT

The release.pl  automatically creates an additional product called the "source 
product" with 100 added to the first number of the given "prodNo".

Appendix B    Making master CDRoms for GemStone  products

Generally manufacturing will be the folks to use these scripts but it will 
be documented here for future reference by any who may find a need to run 
the scripts.  Distribution also has intructions on how to make product 
tapes and CDs.

Making master CDRoms:
---------------------
We put the shippable product on one CD and the sources product on another CD
(these can be combined if they fit).  It is intended that Product and source 
go on separate media to limit the losses in the event of catastrophic media 
failure but redundant backup of this data makes this unneccessary.

1) Go to the PC machine running NT named "burner" in the lab and log in as 
     user "ship" in the "ADMIN" domain.

2) Put a blank CDR in the CD writer.
     Wait for the lights to stop blinking.  The CD is now ready.

3) Run the "Make GemFire CD" shortcut found on the desktop

4) Now we are ready to start making the CD.  For this example we will make
     a master CD for GemFire 4.0 for Solaris (partnumber 13-10-4.0-0-0-0).

     In this DOS window it will say:
        Serial number (for masters, use 'release'):
     Type in release and enter.

     You then MAY now be asked if you wish to include some part numbers
     which we generally put on all disks sent to customers.  For this
     master we do NOT need these so respond with "n" for "no" to each of
     these queries.

     You will now be prompted:
        Product part numbers to add (or "?" for menu):
     Type in the part number 13-10-4.0-0-0-0 and enter

     or if the product archive you need is listed as a package you can 
     select it. 

     You will now be prompted:
        Please choose an action
         1. add products                     4. show status
         2. remove a product                 5. make the CDRom dirs!
         3. change serial                    6. quit (no creation)

     Type in 4 and enter and verify the part number that is displayed.
     You will then get the same prompt again and now type in 5 and enter.
     The script will now pull the files needed from inventory and put
     them on the PC's local disk.

     When finished pulling files the burner program will be brought up 
     automatically.  Click OK to start the burn.  When done remove the CD 
     and apply the proper label.

6) Exit the CD Burner program.

7) Exit the DOS window.

8) Now make the sources CD by repeating steps 3 through 7 with another
     blank CD and using the sources part number (in the example this part
     number would be 1013-10-4.0-0-0-0).

9) Within 30 days of the release we must update all customers with Source
   Escrow (need to write up these procedures).
