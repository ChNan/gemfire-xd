                   Third-Party Software and GemFireXD 

GemFireXD uses a number of third-party open-source software package.  We
change the package names of the third-party classes in order to ensure
that the version of the third-party software does not conflict with a
version of that software that may be used by a customer.  For instance,
we have renamed org.w3c to com.gemstone.org.w3c.  We use magical UNIX 
commands like the following to change the package names:

$ find src/third-party -name "*.java" | xargs perl -pi -e \
  "s/org\.w3c/com\.gemstone\.org\.w3c/g"

and:

$ find src/third-party -name "*.java" | xargs perl -pi -e \
  "s+org/w3c+com/gemstone/org/w3c+g"

it is built upon GemFire's infastructure.
