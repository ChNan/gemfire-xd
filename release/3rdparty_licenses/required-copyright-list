GemFire Required Copyright Info
[last updated 24-Feb-2005, v3.5.2]

Here is a list of all the gemfire files that need to be updated if 
copyrights change:

release/3rdparty_licenses/required-copyright-list <- you are here

release/3rdparty_licenses/GemFire-third-party-list
release/3rdparty_licenses/GemFireXD-third-party-list
  Descriptions of each 3rd party package, including copyright info. If you add
  a new 3rd party package, update third-party-list then update the files below.

release/docfiles/copyright.html
  Formatted copyright text accessed from doc index. Any copyrights changes
  should also be sent to person in charge of GemFire docs/pubs so that the
  Framemaker pdf versions of the documentations can also be updated. 

src/com/gemstone/gemfire/internal/Banner.java
  Same copyright text as copyright.html, compressed to a single paragraph to
  save space.  The intellectual property statement and the trademarks are 
  already coded in this file in an abbreviated form and rarely need updating. 
  This banner appears at the top of log files, so must be formatted to 75 
  columns (2 spaces of indent followed by max 73 chars), each line coded as 
  a separate string.  Also, HTML code must be converted to ASCII (for example, 
  change "&copy;" to "Copyright"). 

build.xml
  Make sure the javadoc copyrights are updated as they are in a slighly 
  different format then the source copyrights which allow them to miss 
  the copyright sweep changes.
