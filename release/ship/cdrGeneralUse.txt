Instructions for using the CDR makers for one-off and private projects.

Required: PC running Easy CD Creator.

1) Collect the files to put on the CD.  This can be done two ways and depends
   partly on what sort of disk you are making.
   This starts on a UNIX system unless you are making a PC only
   disk (item C below).

   A) ISO 9660 read anywhere disk.  DOS type 8.3 file names ONLY.
      This starts on a Solaris UNIX machine to make the .iso image file.
      (This image file must be copied to the PC after creation.)
      This format is good when the disk you make must be read on both
      PC and UNIX and all your info is wrapped inside a set of zip files.

      For example:
        cd /gcm/where/ship51/scripts     OR
        cd /gcm/where/shipjv20/scripts   (will work the same)
        makecdromimage.pl -f -i /jojo5/gs512 -o /jojo3/gs512.iso
      This invocation follows links and creates the iso image file
      /jojo3/gs512.iso from the contents of the /jojo5/gs512 directory.
      The /jojo5/gs512 directory becomes "/" on the CDRom.

      WATCH THE OUTPUT CAREFULLY for messages about long file/directory names
      being truncated or renamed!!  If this happens you won't get what
      you expect on the disk!!!

      To IGNORE links use:
        makecdromimage.pl -f -i /jojo5/gs512 -o /jojo3/gs512.iso

      You can NOT preserve links with this format unless the links
      are inside a zip or tar file.

      When done (it takes awhile) go to the CDRecorder PC and copy the
      .iso file to directory C:\CDRomIsoDir.

   B) UNIX only disk with long file names.
      This is a RockRidge format disk.  It is readable on UNIX ONLY.
      This starts on a Solaris UNIX machine to make the .iso image file.
      (This image file must be copied to the PC after creation.)
      This format is good for archiving directories from UNIX.  All UNIX
      file names are valid and links can be preserved.

      For example:
        cd /gcm/where/ship51/scripts     OR
        cd /gcm/where/shipjv20/scripts   (will work the same)
        makecdromimage.pl -r -q -i /jojo5/gs512 -o /jojo3/gs512.iso
      This invocation preserves links and creates the iso image file
      /jojo3/gs512.iso from the contents of the /jojo5/gs512 directory.
      The /jojo5/gs512 directory becomes "/" on the CDRom.
      You will be asked to OK a list of links if any are found.
      Look at this list carefully.  Any links that do not point to
      files on the CDRom will likely be BROKEN when the CDRom is mounted.
      Use only relative links to files/directories in your input directory.

      To follow links use:
        makecdromimage.pl -f -r -q -i /jojo5/gs512 -o /jojo3/gs512.iso

      When done (it takes awhile) go to the CDRecorder PC and copy the
      .iso file to directory C:\CDRomIsoDir.

   C) PC only disk with long file names.
      This is all done on the PC.
      This is a Joliet format disk.  It is readable on WinNT/Win95/Win98
      and PC Linux ONLY.  This format is PC specific and allows long,
      PC style file names BUT ONLY UP TO 65 CHARACTERS LONG.  Legal PC
      file names longer than 65 characters will be truncated.
      Links are not supported.

      Copy all files and directories you want put on the CDR to the PC in
      directory
        C:\CDRomTempDir\cdrom
      Clean out any existing files first!!!

   D) UNIX/PC hybrid disk with long file names.
      This is a RockRidge/Joliet hybrid format disk.  It is readable on
      UNIX and PCs.
      This starts on a Solaris UNIX machine to make the .iso image file.
      (This image file must be copied to the PC after creation.)
      Be aware that some UNIX file names are not legal on PCs (for instance
      names with ":" in them) and that legal PC file names can be longer
      than the 65 characters allowed.  Links are not supported in Joliet
      but are supported by RockRidge.  Be carefull.

      For example:
        cd /gcm/where/ship51/scripts     OR
        cd /gcm/where/shipjv20/scripts   (will work the same)
        makecdromimage.pl -r -j -q -i /jojo5/gs512 -o /jojo3/gs512.iso
      This invocation preserves links (for UNIX readers) and creates the
      iso image file /jojo3/gs512.iso from the contents of the /jojo5/gs512
      directory.
      The /jojo5/gs512 directory becomes "/" on the CDRom.
      You will be asked to OK a list of links if any are found.
      Look at this list carefully.  Any links that do not point to
      files on the CDRom will likely be BROKEN when the CDRom is mounted.
      Use only relative links to files/directories in your input directory.
      Links will all be broken when read by a PC.

      To follow links use:
        makecdromimage.pl -f -r -j -q -i /jojo5/gs512 -o /jojo3/gs512.iso

      When done (it takes awhile) go to the CDRecorder PC and copy the
      .iso file to directory C:\CDRomIsoDir.

(At the PC now...)
2) Put a blank disk in the CDR, shiney side up, colored side down.
     Some machines require a cassette and some use a tray.  On the tray
     loading machines PLEASE use the front panel button to open AND close
     the tray to avoid unwanted wear and damage on the machine.

3) Wait for all the lights to stop blinking on the CDR.

4) Start the CDR program:
   A) If you have an image file (a .iso file) just double click on the
      file name.  This starts up Easy CD Creator for you.
      Go to step 5.

   B) If you have a set of files on the PC for a Joliet disk do the following:

     i) From the "Start" "Programs" "Adaptec Easy CD Creator" menu cascade
          open "Easy CD Creator Deluxe".

     ii) From the "File" "Open CD Layout..." popup menu
          double click on "joliet.cl3".

     iii) The top half of the program window shows an Explorer-like interface.
          Explore around until the top right subwindow shows the contents of
          C:\CDRomTempDir\cdrom.  Select all the files and directories and
          drag them to the lower right subwindow.

     iv) In the lower right subwindow select the "REMOVEME" directory.  From
          the "Edit" menu select "Remove" and confirm your choice when asked.

     v) From the "File" menu select "Create CD ...".  This brings up a popup.

5) Start the disk creation:
   In the popup menu that is now up:
   A) In the "General" tab, select "Create CD".
   B) Chose the number of copies to make.
   C) In the "Advanced" tab, select "Disc-at-Once". THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!
   D) Now click the "OK" button.

6) The disk is now being written.  This takes a while, up to 20 minutes
   for 650Meg and a 4x CDRecorder.

7) Wait for the tray or cassette to be ejected by the software.

8) Click the "OK" button that the software presents.

9) Close the program.  DO NOT SAVE ANY CHANGES YOU MAY HAVE MADE IF IT ASKS!!!

10) Label the disk.
   Its best to write on the label BEFORE you apply it to the CDR.
   DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REMOVE OR REPOSITION THE LABEL AFTER IT IS STUCK DOWN
   OR YOU WILL PEAL YOUR DATA RIGHT OFF THE CDR!

   The label goes on the shiney side.

   If you must write on a label after it has been applied, write lightly
   with a ball point pen.  Some felt tips may bleed solvents into the data layer
   and scramble your disk.
   Don't press very hard and you will be fine.
